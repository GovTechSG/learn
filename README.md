# Learning Resources
This is a crowdsourced collection of learning resources.

## How to add a new recommendation
1. Check that your recommendation does not exist yet, so that we don't clutter the collection with duplicates.
1. Create an issue for your recommendation, including a title, URL and description of the resource.
1. Label your recommendation accordingly to make it easily searchable.

## How to enrich our collection
1. Leave a comment with if you've used the resource before, to help others make a better decision before investing time in it.
1. Leave a reaction (emoji button next to the issue title), as that can be used to sort the listing too.
1. Update the labels to improve searchability too.
